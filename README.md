# se12-escape-room
In this assessment, you'll need to put your coding skills to the test as you attempt to escape from the school's new six-story building. Each floor presents a series of challenges that will require you to use your knowledge of Git, arrays, objects, and functions in order to unlock doors, bypass security systems, and ultimately reach the helicopter waiting on the rooftop.
You'll need to carefully manage your code using Git, commit your progress with clear, descriptive messages, and track your work as you navigate through the building. You'll encounter complex puzzles involving nested objects and arrays, where understanding and manipulating data structures will be essential to solving the challenges ahead. Your ability to apply these coding concepts will determine your success in making it out of Comp Sci High!
